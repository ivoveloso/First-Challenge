# First Challenge!

## Description

This is our first challenge of the bootcamp. In a nutshell, the objective of this first challenge was to clean up a given website code.
  
The major issues I saw were based on unnecessary and duplicated specificities in HTML and CSS.

My approach was to simplify the style sheet as much as possible wothout compromising the end result. Consequently, this ended up simplifying the HTML as well.

## Table of Contents

My README is not long in this specific case. But for good practise purposes, I will keep the original framework shown in this example.
